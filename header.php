			            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include: Speech recognition, Learning, Planning, Problem solving.</p>

			            <p>NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.</p>

			            <p>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed where to look. The result? High-value predictions that can guide better decisions and smart actions in real time without human intervention.</p>

			            <p>Deep learning combines advances in computing power and special types of neural networks to learn complicated patterns in large amounts of data. Deep learning techniques are currently state- of-the-art for identifying objects in images and words in sounds. Researchers are now looking to apply these successes in pattern recognition to more complex tasks such as automatic language translation, medical diagnoses and numerous other important social and business problems.</p>

			            <p>Humans use their eyes and their brains to see and visually sense the world around them. Computer vision is the science that aims to give a similar, if not better, capability to a machine or computer. Computer Vision typically refers to the scientific discipline of giving machines the ability of sight, or perhaps more colourfully, enabling machines to visually analyse their environments and the stimuli within them. This process typically involves the evaluation of an image, images or video.</p>

			            <p>In machine learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed- forward artificial neural networks that has successfully been applied to analyzing visual imagery. Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in which the connectivity pattern between neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex.</p>

			            <p>A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data.</p>
